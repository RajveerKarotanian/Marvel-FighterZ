**MAIN CLASS** - Menu Class  

The Menu class must be run inorder for this program to work. Opening the Menu greets you with a title page,
where you must press "Start" to reach the next screen. The following screen gives the option to pick a
desired gamemode: FFA (Free For All), or TEAMS (Two teams of two).

	FFA - 	Free for All (no teams, all solo), user is able to able to enter the names for 4 different heroes

	Teams - Two teams, each with two players. You may cycle through the heroes by clicking on them, and then confirming your choice with the
		confirm button placed underneath that specific hero. This program does not allow for duplicate characters. After picking the
		second character for the second team, you may enter the names for the teams, which will be displayed for the winner at the
		end of round.

After going through the gamemode selection, you will enter a background selection screen, where you are able to chose between 3 options.
You will have to select a background before confirming an option. After this, you will enter a path selection screen. There are 2 options.
Linear or Around, where the first option sets the game configuration to make the heroes travel straight across the background, and the 
second option sets the game configuration to make the heroes travel around the background. After this, if you originally chose the
FFA gamemode, you are given an extra option to reset previous scores, where you will have to select "Yes" or "No". Selecting yes 
starts the game with everyone having a score of 0, where selecting no starts the game off with everyone keeping their scores from the last
time the program was ran.
